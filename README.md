# Bridget

Bridge Template Upload.

Watch local template folder for changes, and auto-upload template to an associated Bridge dev server, through Bridge API.

# 1. Use it!

## Installation (OSX 10.7.5)

Either

1. Download the latest standalone, prebuilt binary (OSX only - 24MB): http://cl.ly/3j3Y090F3T2w

2. Download the [node-webkit binary](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads) and the latest [Bridget.nw](https://github.com/julienma/Bridget/raw/master/build/Bridget.nw)

### Growl notifications (optional)

You should install [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify) if you want to get Growl notifications when uploads are done.

### Compatibility

This is tested and working on OSX only.

As it is implemented now, it could theorically work on Windows with minimal code adaptation.
However, it is currently based on cURL and zip OSX binaries, so until those features are built-in (using Node modules), you will have to manually install cURL and zip's windows-compatible CLIs. And even then, it's not garanteed to work.

## Usage

TODO

### Settings file

Your watched folders are saved in a hidden `.bridget_settings.json` JSON file in your $HOME directory.
It is created the first time you add a watched folder.
You can back it up if needed.

Note that it should never be empty, otherwise app won't load.
If you want to reset your watched directory, do not empty and save the file, just delete it.

# 2. Hack it!

## Prerequisites

### Node & node-webkit

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (> 0.8.16): recommanded installation through [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm). Used for development only, as node-webkit has its own node binary already built-in.
- [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) (> 0.3.6): download [prebuilt binary](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads), and drop it in your Applications folder (OSX)

### Node modules

These are already included in the repo under `./node_modules`.
You can reinstall / update them through [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) (should already be shipped with any recent version of Node).

- [Watchr](https://github.com/bevry/watchr): provides a normalised API the file watching APIs of different node versions, nested/recursive file and directory watching, and accurate detailed events for file/directory creations, updates, and deletions.

```
npm install watchr
```

- [nconf](https://github.com/flatiron/nconf): save and load node.js configuration to JSON files.

```
npm install nconf
```

- [node-growl](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl): Growl support for Nodejs. Needs [growlnotify(1)](http://growl.info/extras.php#growlnotify).

```
npm install growl
```

## Build (OSX 10.7.5)

Make sure the _build.command script is executable

```
chmod u+x _build.command
```

Make sure your package.json references your entry point file, e.g:
```
{
  "main": "source/init.html"
}
```

Then run it, it will package both Bridget.nw (light archive needing node-webkit binary) and Bridget.app (standalone app -- but far bigger).
It will also open the .app so you can test it immediately.

For development, you can run _test.command instead, it will just package an _app.nw and launch it through node-webkit.
